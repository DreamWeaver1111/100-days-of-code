# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday, June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Getting more comfortable with media quaries, float properties, position, z-index, and ::before and ::after through a Udemy course. Also, worked on a technical documentation page for freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: These last few concepts have been a little difficult for me but it's nice to have a different resource. FreeCodeCamp didn't really give me a clear understanding of these concepts.
